// Malachi Maldonado
// CMPM120 
// Developed with help from Eliana Cadelina and Denae :p on the class Discord.
// Based on code by Adam Smith. 
// =================Mod Breakdown======================
// - Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (60)
//      Changed the theme to a phone UI, where the player has to ward off unwanted
//      attention. Uses meme sounds, emojis, and a different menu/game over screen.
//
// - Display the time remaining (in seconds) on the screen (10)
//      
// - Create 4 new explosion SFX and randomize which one plays on impact (10)
//      I didn't do this exactly, but I randomized the rocket sprite each time a
//      spaceship is hit. Some rockets have special sounds.
// 
// - Created a new title screen/game over screen with mouse control (?)
//      I changed the title screen and game over screen to listen for a mouse click
//      on specified buttons instead of keyboard control. The title screen has buttons
//      for easy and hard difficulties; the game over screen has a button to
//      restart, and a button to return to the menu. I believe this mod is worth 20 points,
//      since it includes both menus and button controls.
